# Structured-Data-Learning-and-Prediction
 The three notebooks 'NER_constant & decaying smoothing.ipynb', 'NER smoothing coefficient.ipynb' and 'NER regularisation.ipynb' are notebooks that I use to do experiments.
 I used the package Casimir created by the author of the paper \textit{A Smoother Way to Train Structured Prediction Models}, here is the link https://github.com/krishnap25/casimir.
